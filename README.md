## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for my Bachelor Thesis project, "Personalized Stock Recommender." The project was completed in May 2021 and aimed to design a system that provides personalized stock portfolio recommendations based on user interests and risk tolerance.

## Project Details

- **Title:** Personalized Stock Recommender
- **Completion Date:** May 2021
- **Degree:** Bachelor Thesis

## Features

- Utilized clustering techniques to assess user risk tolerance and preferences.
- Developed a personalized stock portfolio recommendation system based on user interests.
- Deployed the entire system as an end-to-end CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins across Amazon EC2 instance.

## How It Works

The Personalized Stock Recommender uses clustering algorithms to analyze user-provided data, such as historical investment behavior, financial goals, and risk preferences. Based on this information, the system assesses the user's risk tolerance level and identifies their interests in different types of stocks.

Using the collected data, the recommender system generates a personalized stock portfolio that aligns with the user's risk profile and investment preferences.

## Deployment

The entire system has been deployed as an end-to-end CI/CD pipeline, allowing for seamless updates and maintenance. The deployment utilizes Jenkins for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) across an Amazon EC2 instance.
